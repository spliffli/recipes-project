    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I haven't personally tried this dish yet, but it looks like it could be very addictive during the winter.</p>
    <p>It's a soup with mixed vegetables, cheese and tortellini for 8 people.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>680g (1.5 lbs) <strong>veggie</strong> sausage (Not the original recipe, but this is what I will use)</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 cups veggie broth</li>
        <li>170g (16 Oz.) peeled & chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups thinly sliced carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced celery</li>
        <li>1 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>¾ cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>30g package tortellini</li>
        <li>2 cups thinly sliced zucchini</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated cheese, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

            <h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
            <p>Heat a Dutch oven or large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the Dutch oven until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is tender, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
            
            <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
            <p>Stir broth, tomatoes, carrots, celery, ketchup, and red wine into veggie sausage mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until carrots and celery are tender, about 30 minutes. Add tortellini and zucchini to the soup and cover; simmer until zucchini are tender, 25 to 30 more minutes. Ladle soup into serving bowls and top with cheese.</p>
