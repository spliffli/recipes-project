    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This street-style falafel sandwich is herbaceous, tangy and rich. The falafel gets nice and crispy in the oven while the veggies inside keep it simple and fresh. Make the tahini sauce (see Associated Recipes) ahead of time for easy prep. Wrapping the sandwich in foil makes it a perfect bring-along lunch and helps hold it together for eating on the go.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>Cooking spray</li>
       <li>1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added chickpeas, rinsed</li>
       <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
       <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
       <li>½ cup grated red onion, plus 1 cup thinly sliced, divided</li>
       <li>¼ cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon tahini</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice, divided</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
       <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
       <li>1 large clove garlic, grated</li>
       <li>1 cup thinly sliced English cucumber</li>
       <li>1 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
       <li>4 (10-inch) whole-wheat wraps</li>
       <li>2 cups loosely packed arugula</li>
       <li>1 large tomato, cut into 8 slices</li>
       <li>1 recipe Tahini Sauce with Lemon & Garlic (see Associated Recipes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
            <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil; coat with cooking spray.</p>            
            <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
            <p>Pulse chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, grated onion, panko, tahini, lemon zest, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, cumin, salt and garlic in a food processor until a coarse meal forms, 10 to 12 pulses, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Shape the mixture into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) patties (about 1/2 cup each). Arrange the patties on the prepared baking sheet; coat tops with cooking spray. Bake for 10 minutes. Flip the patties; coat tops with cooking spray. Continue baking until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.</p>
            <h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
            <p>Meanwhile, combine sliced onion, cucumber, oil and the remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a medium bowl. Let stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes.</p>
            <h3><strong>Step 4</strong></h3>
            <p>Remove the patties from the oven; let cool for 5 minutes. Cut in half.</p>
            <h3><strong>Step 5</strong></h3>
            <p>Meanwhile, place wraps directly on oven racks; bake until just warmed through, about 1 minute.</p>
            <h3><strong>Step 6</strong></h3>
            <p>Add arugula to the cucumber mixture; toss to combine. Place the warmed wraps on a work surface; top evenly with the arugula mixture, falafel halves, tomato slices and tahini sauce. Working with 1 wrap at a time, fold 1 side of the wrap over the center and roll up burrito-style. Wrap the bottom half with foil to hold the wrap together.</p>
